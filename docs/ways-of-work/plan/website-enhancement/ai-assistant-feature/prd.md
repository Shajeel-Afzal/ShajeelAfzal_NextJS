# AI Assistant Feature

## Epic

- **Parent Epic:** Website Enhancement Initiative
- **Feature:** AI Assistant Integration with AI SDK v5

## Goal

### Problem
Visitors to Shajeel Afzal's personal website currently have limited ways to interact and get personalized information about services, expertise, and project inquiries.
