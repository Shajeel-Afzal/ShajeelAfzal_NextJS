# Courses Listing Feature PRD

## Feature Name
**Personal Website Courses Catalog**

## Epic
Personal Website Enhancement - Adding Educational Content Section

## Goal

### Problem
Currently, the personal website showcases services and portfolio but lacks a dedicated section to display educational courses and training materials. Visitors cannot easily discover and access the course offerings, which limits the educational impact and potential revenue streams from course sales.

### Solution
Implement a comprehensive courses listing feature that displays all available courses in an organized, searchable, and filterable format. Users can browse courses, view detailed information, and be directed to third-party platforms for enrollment without requiring authentication on the personal website.

### Impact
- **SEO Enhancement:** Increase organic search traffic through course-specific landing pages
- **User Engagement:** Provide educational value to website visitors
- **Lead Generation:** Direct qualified leads to third-party course platforms
- **Professional Positioning:** Establish expertise and thought leadership in the field
