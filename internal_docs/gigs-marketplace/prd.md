# Gigs Marketplace Feature - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Feature Name

**Fiverr-Style Gigs Marketplace Integration**

## 2. Epic

**Parent Epic:** Professional Portfolio & Consultation Platform (Reference: `/internal_docs/project_requirements.md`)

**Related Architecture:** This feature extends the existing professional portfolio platform by adding a comprehensive service marketplace, transforming the static services catalog into an interactive, purchasable gigs platform similar to Fiverr.

## 3. Goal

### Problem
The current website showcases services through a static catalog with general descriptions and subcategories. Potential clients can view service offerings but lack the ability to:
- Browse specific service packages with detailed pricing
- View comprehensive service details including media (images, videos, PDFs)
- Read authentic client reviews and ratings
- Compare different service tiers and pricing models
- Make direct purchases with clear expectations
- Access detailed FAQs and service specifications

### Solution
Implement a comprehensive gigs marketplace that transforms the existing service categories into purchasable gigs with detailed information, media galleries, client reviews, flexible pricing models (fixed, hourly, monthly), and a streamlined purchasing flow. Each gig will function as a standalone product page with rich content, social proof, and clear calls-to-action.

### Impact
**Expected Outcomes:**
- **Increased conversion rate:** From 5% (current consultation bookings) to 15% through clear service packages
- **Average order value increase:** 40% higher than current consultation revenue through tiered service offerings
- **Client acquisition cost reduction:** 30% decrease through transparent pricing and self-service purchasing
- **Time-to-purchase reduction:** From 5-7 days (consultation → proposal → negotiation) to same-day purchases
- **Client satisfaction improvement:** Through clear expectations, reviews, and detailed service descriptions

**Key Metrics:**
- Monthly gig purchases: Target 50+ transactions by month 3
- Average gig value: $500-2,500 depending on service tier
- Customer satisfaction score: 4.8+ stars average rating
- Repeat purchase rate: 25% within 6 months

### Service Architecture

The gigs marketplace will integrate with the existing service architecture while maintaining clear separation of concerns:

**Gig Service Layer**
- `GigService`: Core CRUD operations for gigs
- `GigSearchService`: Search and filtering functionality
- `GigAnalyticsService`: Performance tracking and analytics

**Order Management Service**
- `OrderService`: Order creation and management
- `PaymentService`: Integration with Stripe for payments
- `DeliveryService`: Order fulfillment tracking

**Review System Service**
- `ReviewService`: Review CRUD operations
- `RatingCalculationService`: Average rating calculations
- `ReviewModerationService`: Spam and inappropriate content filtering

This comprehensive PRD provides the foundation for implementing a professional gigs marketplace that extends the existing portfolio platform while maintaining high standards for user experience, performance, and business outcomes.
